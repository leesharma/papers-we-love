* [Molecular Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems]
  by Leonard M. Adleman (1994)
    - An interesting and inspiring approach to solving the (NP-complete)
      Hamiltonian Graph problem.

* [The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]
  by Alan M. Turing (1952)
    - How we can generate patterns from reaction-diffusion models and how those
      models apply in real life situations: cells self-organisation and pattern
      creation.
    - Includes advance mathematical concepts, basic chemistry, basic biology.
