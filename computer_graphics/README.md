  [Digital Video Stabilization and Rolling Shutter Correction using Gyroscopes]
  by Alexandre Karpenko et al. (2011)

  > This is a really great paper that is both complex and straightforward.
  > This paper "present a robust, real-time video stabilization and rolling
  > shutter correction technique based on gyroscopes". I think this is a great
  > paper because it makes a clever use of a commodity technology
  > (smartphones' gyroscopes) to make a state-of-the-art improvement to a
  > central components of phones: video cameras by removing the shakes and
  > rolling shutter artifacts of a video in real-time.

  application of grammar-driven generation:

### Mesh Editing

* [PushPull++]
  by Peter Wonka et al. (2014)

  > Of all the ways to manipulate a 3D mesh, push/ technique popularized by
  > SketchUp is one of the most approachable and fun. PushPull++ is a recent
  > paper that elaborates on the technique, cleaning up a lot of edge cases
  > and unlocking new features, using wonderfully straightforward math. The
  > potential for 3D modeling tools or procedural mesh generation APIs built
  > on these simple ideas is very exciting.
  >
  > The paper presents the technique and the tool that the authors built. I
  > will focus on the technique, as s the part I loved more in this paper
  > (quote by Ramsey Nasser).

### Shape grammars

* [Shape Grammars and the Generative Specification of Painting and Sculpture]
  by George Stiny and James Gip (1971)
    - A seminal paper that lead to many interesting applications in
      graphics as well as more broadly in design; see also the
      bibliography at [shapegrammar.org](http://shapegrammar.org/).
