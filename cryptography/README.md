* [A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography]
  by Claude E. Shannon (1945)

  The original classified memo for Bell Labs that was republished in 1949 as
  "[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]".

  [A Mathematical Theory of Communication]
  by Claude E. Shannon (1948)

  Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and
  cryptography developed simultaneously and that "they were so close together
  you couldnâ€™t separate them". ["Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems"]
  incorporates many concepts and formulations that also appeared in his 1948
  paper.
